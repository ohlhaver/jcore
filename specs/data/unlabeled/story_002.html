If it is rejected a second time, it would provide the Labor government with the authority to dissolve both houses of parliament and call an early election barely two years into its current term.</p><p>The previous Liberal/National party coalition government, which had failed to ratify the Kyoto protocol on <a href="http://www.ft.com/indepth/climatechange" class="bodystrong">climate change</a>, had been voted out of office partly on the grounds it had not been more proactive on global warming issues.</p><p>Malcolm Turnbull, leader of the Liberal/National party coalition, has polled poorly in recent months compared with Kevin Rudd, prime minister. Mr Turnbull has also failed to present a clear policy alternative and he has struggled to maintain unity within his own ranks.</p><p>The Liberal/National coalition would almost certainly lose an early election amid growing frustration within Australia over the opposition’s political intransigence.</p><p>A poll out this month from Roy Morgan, the market research group, found that 55 per cent of Australians approved the government’s CTS legislation, with less than a quarter saying it did not go far enough.</p><p>Support for the CTS was highest among young Australians, while only 45 per cent of those over 50 approved of the legislation.</p><p>Thursday’s rejection – voted down by 42 senators versus 30 who supported it – was greeted with dismay by environmental groups and Australian businesses supportive of the legislation.</p><p>John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute, a research group, said: “This is a tragic postponement of the evolution of Australia’s polluting, inefficient and climate exposed economy.” </p><p>On a per capita basis, Australia is the developed world’s highest polluting country because its energy needs rely heavily on burning fossil fuels.</p><p>However, Nick Minchin, leader of the Liberal party in the Senate, welcomed the rejection and called for the legislation not to re-introduced until after Copenhagen.</p><p>“Every non-government senator voted against the government’s bill,” he said.</p><p>“Labor’s bill would have cost thousands of jobs, reduced Australian living standards, substantially raised the price of everyone’s electricity and damaged the Australian economy all for absolutely zero environmental gain,” he said.</p><p>He added the government should put this ”damaging bill in the deep-freeze” until after the Copenhagen outcome and the US senate debate on emissions trading.</p><p>Senator Penny Wong, climate change minister, attacked opponents of the bill and said the legislation would be re-introduced this year.</p><p>“This bill may be going down today, but this is not the end.”</p><p>“It’s not smart to pretend this won’t leave us isolated from the rest of the world, and it’s not smart to undermine our transition to a low-carbon economy,” she said. </p></div></div><p class="copyright"><a href="http://www.ft.com/servicestools/help/copyright">Copyright</a> The Financial Times Limited 2009.
